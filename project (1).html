    <h2>Drowsy Driver alert system</h2>
        <p> Abstract—Drowsy Driver Alert System has been developed using a non-intrusive
            machine vision concepts.
            • The system uses a small monochrome security camera that points directly towards
            the driver’s face and monitors the driver’s eyes in order to detect fatigue. In such a
            case when fatigue is detected, a warning signal is issued to alert the driver.
            • The system deals with using information obtained for the binary version of the
            image to find the edges of the face, which narrows the area of where the eyes may
            exist.
